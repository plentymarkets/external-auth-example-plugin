# external-auth-example-plugin
This is an *example* plugin for Plentymarkets to show how to use the plenty Interface to implement login with external auth-providers. **Do not use this in a production environment!**

This plugin uses the [Google API](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/). You need a *Google Client-ID*, which you will have to enter in the plugins config. However, the functionality of the Google API is not part of the scope of this example plugin and will not be explained in detail. Please refer to the [official documentation from Google](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/).

If you're having trouble implementing this, leave a post in our [Support Forum](https://forum.plentymarkets.com).
